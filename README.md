# ComfyUI-Loop
A pair of nodes to create a simple loop in your workflows. The operating principle is quite straightforward: the image saved by the 'Save Image (LOOP)' node overwrites the image specified in the 'image path' field, allowing it to be automatically reloaded in the next iteration.

The code is fairly basic, but special care was taken to protect the image data to prevent degradation after multiple iterations. Visually, there is no loss in quality after 150 iterations. Theoretically, the same result should hold even after a thousand successive saves.

Limitations:

No support for image lists as input for 'Save Image (LOOP)'. If provided, only the first image will be saved and displayed.
If a mask is present, it must match the image format to be saved in the alpha channel of the output image. Otherwise, an error message will appear in the console, and your image will be returned in RGB mode instead of RGBA.
No preview available in the 'Load Image' node (theoretically, you know what youâ€™ve loaded, right? :) )
No preview in the 'Save Image' node if the image is located outside the output folder.

FUTURE PLANS

This is an alpha version put together in one evening. I will revisit the code later, but for now, it works as expected.
